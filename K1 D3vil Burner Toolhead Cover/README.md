## Introduction

D3vil Design is proud to release the D3vil Burner toolhead cover for the Creality K1 for **free**.

- Customizable LED featuring the D3vil Design logo - use any LED to match the style of your setup!

## Installation Guide

1. Download and print both STLs in this folder - the toolhead cover and the D3D logo. Recommended print settings for each are as follows:

   ##### D3vil Burner Toolhead Cover

   - Material: ABS, ASA, or another heat-resistant material
   - Layer Height: 0.2
   - Line width: 0.4
   - Walls: 3
   - Top/Bottom Layers: 3
   - Supports required (Top Z distance somewhere around 0.15)
   - orientation: print it facing up for the best results. 
   - Color: Your Choice!
     

   ##### D3vil Burner D3D Logo

   - Material: ABS, ASA, PETG, or another heat-resistant material
   - Layer Height: 0.2
   - Line width: 0.4
   - Walls: 3
   - Top/Bottom Layers: 3
   - Supports required (Top Z distance somewhere around 0.15)
   - Color: White or Transparent (we want light to shine through)

2. Remove the two screws from the stock toolhead cover and slide the cover off
3. Disconnect the front fan from the toolhead board and remove the fan from the stock toolhead cover
4. Slide the D3D Logo piece into the slot on the new toolhead's slot.
5. Connect a wire to the Knomi:

   ##### If you're not using an LED:

   5a. Find or create an MX1.25 (2pin) to MX1.25 (3pin) wire. Red to red, black to black according to the pinout shown on the board itself (Red to V and Black to G). We won't use the 3rd pin - this is just so we can connect it easily.

   5b. Connect the MX1.25 2pin to the Knomi **AND GENTLY PRY OFF THE USB PORT FROM THE KNOMI. IT DOES NOT FIT IN A STOCK SETUP**, then GENTLY (do not force, you'll crack the screen!) slide the Knomi into it's place from the back in.

   ##### If you are using an LED:

   5a. Create a three-way wire. This wire should be an MX1.25 (2pin) to MX1.25 (3pin) to V/G (whatever your LED needs) wire. Red to red to read, black to black to black according to the pinout shown on the board itself (Red to V and Black to G). We won't use the 3rd pin - this is just so we can connect it easily.

    <img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" width="100%" class="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3vil-Design/K1-Hardware-Mods/main/K1%20D3vil%20Burner%20Toolhead%20Cover/images/db connector.jpg">

   5b. Solder or attach your V/G to your LED - the voltage is 5V coming from the toolboard - make sure your LED supports this or use a resistor.

   5c. There are two slots where you can lay your wires to prop up the LED. Attach those and prop your LED against the D3D logo piece.

   5d. Connect the MX1.25 2pin to the Knomi **AND GENTLY PRY OFF THE USB PORT FROM THE KNOMI. IT DOES NOT FIT IN A STOCK SETUP**, then GENTLY (do not force, you'll crack the screen!) slide the Knomi into it's place from the back in.

7. Slide the fan against the Knomi and attach the fan using the stock screws.
8. Connect the other end of the Knomi wire to the free filament sensor port on the toolhead board (again, outlined on the pinout shown on the board, Red to V and Black to G).
9. Re-attach the fan wire to the toolhead board.
10. Slide the D3vil Burner on to the toolhead and re-attach using the stock screws.
11. Vo√≠la! Re-run input shaping, connect your Knomi following [BTT's instructions](https://github.com/bigtreetech/KNOMI/blob/master/KNOMI_USER_GUIDE.pdf).
12. NOTE: When connecting to Knomi Via wifi, in the setup screen, you will have to Add the IP address of your Printer ( Since this only works with Rooted Printers ) you will have to add the IP and the Port (ex: 192.168.1.10:4408 ).
