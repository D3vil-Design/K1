## INTRODUCTION
Main reason for the creation of this mod was to fix the issue of the gantry not being square in my machine throwing off the mesh. It has since fixed the "unlevel" or "warped" bed and has also resulted in quieter operation of the printer. Having a custom gantry also opens the door to future upgrades/mods. These mounts have gone through weeks of testing and have proven to be more than capable of handling the K1. 

With the V2 Gantry, replacing the factory steppers and 36t timing gears resulted in a massive drop in vibrations in the gantry. Moving the belt tensioners to the front idler mounts has also made it much easier to tension the belts and fixed the issue of the factory tensioner buckling in the factory stepper mounts.

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Rigidity is important. Print the mounts using the recommended print settings or better
- Push the heat-set inserts into place as straight as possible or you will end up with alignment issues with the holes in the frame
- Make sure the inserts sit flush and that you don't heat the surrounding plastic more than necessary
- Use M5x5mm grub screws to hold the Y axis rods on all mounts
- Snug the Y rod grub screws after installing the gantry in the printer
